Work:

P1
* new config entry
  * validation: domain already in the DB?  config wrong?
  * correct models (e.g. authentication types, etc.)
  * language list for popup
* remove buttons for +1 and -1
* command line script to export XML files w/ some sane convention
* in review process, allow choice when marking invalid
  - "not available from our domain"
  - "incorrect data"
  - "other"
  (in addition to textfield)

P2
* allow reviewer-only comments: not visible to non reviewers
* review process: have backend script to do telnet/ssh call to the ports,
  detect IMAP settinsgs, etc.
* annotate results of backend script to the configuration
* think about how to indicate when a record is out of date, the new record is in the db, but the old one is still being published (link to actual http:// data)
* settings page language detection?
* allow addition of domains to existing configurations

Quality:
* test convert -> export compare w/ original data
* test suite

Prettier:vi
* CSS: make comment form prettier
* django/ajax: fix comment submission (ajax baby!)
